# Team Profile Generator ![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

This week's challenge had us build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. We wrote unit tests for each part of your code and ensure that it passes all of them.

### Challenge criteria

* GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
* WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information
* THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input
* WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML
* THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address
* WHEN I click on the GitHub username
* THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
* WHEN I start the application
* THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
* WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
* THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team
* WHEN I select the engineer option
* THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
* WHEN I select the intern option
* THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu
* WHEN I decide to finish building my team
* THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated

### Usage
Developers must familiarize themselves with using their terminal to input information. The process is as simple as typing `node index.js` in the terminal and answer the questions following the prompts. All of the input information will get pushed out into html file.
